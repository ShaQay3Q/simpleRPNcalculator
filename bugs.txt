1. new line (\n): I tried to use <(echo "1 2 printIt") as argument, so it put my argunemts in a file on memory
which can be passed as file address to the program. it hase an extra new line in it (\n) which prevent my program
from calculating the file contenct. I had to give rid of it by passing <(echo -n "1 2 + printIt").
But that means, I need to handle new lines as a bug.

2. 


// when sth new is installed on a terminal and other terminal was open "rehash" is the command to execute.
